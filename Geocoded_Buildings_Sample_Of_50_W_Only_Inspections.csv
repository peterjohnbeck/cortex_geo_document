LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS

This report represents the professional opinion of Olympic Building Inspections & Engineering based on visual observation of accessible areas only. Hidden or inaccessible areas were not inspected. This report is not a guarantee or warranty of building conditions or systems.

The inspection was performed in accordance with standard industry practices but was limited to visual observation of accessible areas. No removal of materials or testing was performed unless specifically noted.

This report is prepared exclusively for the client and may not be relied upon by any other party without written consent from Olympic Building Inspections & Engineering.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. Comprehensive asbestos survey

- Establish preventive maintenance schedule for elevators

Long Term:
- Develop capital improvement plan
- Consider energy efficiency upgrades
- Plan for complete mechanical system modernization
- Implement water management strategy

BUILDING OCCUPANCY CONSIDERATIONS

Current 50% occupancy presents both challenges and opportunities:
- Reduced income affects capital improvement capability
- Allows for phased renovations with minimal tenant disruption
- Opportunity to upgrade vacant spaces to increase marketability

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Current conditions indicate poor energy efficiency:
- Single-pane windows
- Minimal insulation
- Inefficient HVAC systems
- Opportunities for significant improvement through upgrades

ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE

Several ADA compliance issues noted:
- Non-compliant entrance ramps
- Inadequate door clearances
- Non-compliant bathroom fixtures
- Estimated cost for compliance: $250,000 (included in Priority 3 costs)

CONCLUSION

The subject property at 45 Fleet Walk exhibits conditions typical of a 100-year-old building with deferred maintenance. While the building remains serviceable, significant investment is required to address deteriorating conditions and bring systems up to current standards. The estimated total cost of $2,225,000 represents necessary improvements over the next 36 months to maintain building viability and improve marketability.
